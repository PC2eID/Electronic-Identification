Positioning NFID as the Internet Computer "Gold-Standard" Key-Management plug-in across the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) / European Economic Area (EEA) in advance of the September 2022 eIDAS2 'toolbox' release is the primary focus of this updated Swiss Electronic Identification (eID) Use Case.

The countdown for EU member state governments', private-sector SMEs, investors, developers, and entrepreneurs vying to update pre-notified/notified national eID schemes infrastructure under the prior eIDAS (electronic identification, strong-authentication and trust services)

eIDAS 2.0 has evolved from eIDs to the European Commission's first update to its pan-EEA/EFTA Digital Identity framework. Introducing the European Digital Identity Wallet. (EUDIW)

"With eIDAS 2, the EU Commission intends to make cross-border e-ID a reality. In a nutshell, by 2023, every EU member state must make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one." https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/eidas-regulations

EIRA© (European Interoperability Reference Architecture), which defines the functionality of eIDAS 2.0, proposes to mandate for the EUDIW via autonomous and (re)usable EIRA© Solution Building Block (SBB) that map to Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) of EIRA©

eIDAS legal framework for electronic signatures was subsequently amended in the eIDAS Regulation with four additional services:

1.	electronic seals (electronic signatures for legal persons),
2.	website authentication, 
3.	timestamping and
4.	registered delivery services.

EU nations will be mandated to build an architecture to launch and support the new cross-border EDIW national eID schemes in 2023.

Designing an NFID-Dfinity IC-based Swiss eID as a collaborative non-competitive component of EIRA© in support of:

a.	the Q1 2022 Swisscom and Orell Füssli digital certificate partnership 
b.	the Q1 2022 SwissSign SSI-joint State of Aargau and Adnovum project 
c.	the State of Zug decentralised identity for eGov ti&m, HSLU, and 
d.	uPort project could be a low hanging fruit opportunity.

Considered the most advanced Swiss eID projects with considerable resources, they may find NFIDs build on the only entirely non-profit Swiss Web3 Foundation's synergistic value proposition. Based on NFIDs, FIDO2/WebAuthn innovations - built on the Dfinity's enterprise-web speed public blockchain, the Internet Computer.

The Federal Department of Justice/Police (FDJP) and DigitalSwitzerland recommended ensuring an EU interoperable Swiss eID despite a real chance that stalled EU-Swiss treaty agreement negotiations could limit access to the EU's Horizon Europe Digital Identity funding programs.

„Without too much fanfare, the European Commission has recently put forward plans that might cause the largest leap forward in the European digital identity scene in the past twenty years.“ https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/european-digital-identity-framework/

With eIDAS 2, the EU Commission intends to make cross-border e-ID a reality.

The development of a Dfinity-IC-based NFID-Suiss--an "anonymous by default strong-authentication process" accelerates NFID's mission to become the privacy-preserving identity layer of the Internet.

Offering a Self-Sovereign, Non-Fungible Identity Choice to the 508 million citizens of the Digital Single Market, one of the European Commission's 10 political priorities close the digital gap with the U.S. and China. 

$20 trillion in GDP, Europe has the 2nd largest GDP globally right behind China and ahead of the US. Brexit showcased despite the EU representing 15% of the world's economy, it is forcast to fall to about 12% by 2030.

The EUDIW touted as the remedy to reverse the forcast; Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is touted by only a few as key to the commission’s economic growth initiative.  

Although elimanating US and China platform pan-EU lock-in manadotry for EUDIWs, there is no mandate from the EU that all member states use blockchain technology to implement the European digital identity framework.

NFID is well positioned to offer

* data-subject controlled
* secure and frictionless
* privacy-preserving
* platform-agostic eIDs across the EU.

Comprehensive new 2022 European consumer protection regulations for eIDs unveil greenfield opportunities for complementary eID identification, strong-authentication and authorization.  

The ojective is to implement FIDO2 standard, consisting of the W3C WebAuthn standard and the FIDO Client to Autheticator Protocol (CTAP) and deploy the plugable web-interface from Crypto Valley as EIRA© SBB. 

In compliance with not only the EU privacy laws consisting of the 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) and 
the European Data Protection Board. (EDPB) 

The privacy invoked by EU data protection regulations is based on the constitutional privacy declarations in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: Articles 7 and 8 mandate individual EU citizens the respect for private life and the protection of personal data.

They are forming the most enforceable transparant and accountable data protection regulatory compliance structure for controlling the processing and flow of Personal Identifiable Data (PID) on the European continent.  

By monetising the wave of NexGen eTrust Regulation guidelines on enforcement in the EU and the privacy decision directives in the pipeline:

° the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)
° the Data Act (DA)
° the Data Governance Act (DGA)
° the European Digital Identity Framework (EDIF)
° the Digital Markets Act (DMA)
° the Digital Services Act (DSA)
° the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
° the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Identity Proofing Standard
° the Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2)
° the 5th Anti Money Laundering Directive (AML5)
° the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)
° the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)
° the Standard contractual Clauses (SCC)
° the new electronic IDentification, Authentic and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0)
° the Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) Toolkit

In convergence with the (fully-revised) 2022 Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and the New Swiss DLT Act, they facilitate digital identity for all European citizens and a new universal standard for the world.

The 2021 DLT Law is one of the only blockchain legal frameworks that foster clear-line-of-liability for cross-border data-privacy-protected eService transactions
