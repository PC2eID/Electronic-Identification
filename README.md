Positioning NFID as the Internet Computer "Gold-Standard" Key-Management plug-in accross the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) / European Economic Area (EEA) in advance of the September 2022 eIDAS2 ‘toolbox’ release is primary focus of this updated Swiss Electronic Identification (eID) Use Case.

The countdown for EU member state governments', private-sector SMEs, investors, developers, and entrepernuers vying to update pre-notified/notified national eID schemes infrastructure under the prior eIDAS (electronic identification, authentication and trust services)

eIDAS 2.O has evolved from eIDs to the European Commission's first update to its pan-EEA/EFTA Digital Identity framework. Introducing the European Digital Identity Wallet. (EUDIW)

"With eIDAS 2, the EU Commission intends to make cross-border e-ID a reality. In a nutshell, by 2023, every EU member state must make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one." https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/eidas-regulations

EIRA© (European Interoperability Reference Architecture), which defines the functionality eIDAS 2.0 proposes to mandate for the EUDIW via autonomous and (re)usable EIRA© Solution Building Block (SBB) that map to Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) of EIRA©

The legal framework for electronic signatures was subsequently amended in the eIDAS Regulation with 4 additional services including 

electronic seals (electronic signatures for legal persons), 
website authentication, 
timestamping and 
registered delivery services.

EU nations will be mandated to build an architecture to launch and support of the new cross-border EDIW national eID schemes in 2023.

Designing a NFID-Dfinity IC based Swiss eID as a collaborative non-competitive component of EIRA© in support of:

a) the Q1 2022 Swisscom and Orell Füssli digital certificate partnership
b) the Q1 2022 SwissSign SSI-joint State of Aargau, and Adnovum project
c) the State of Zug decentralised identity for eGov ti&m, HSLU, and uPort project could be a low hanging fruit oppurtunity.

Considered the most advanced Swiss eID projects with considerable resources, they may find NFIDs build on the only fully non-profit Swiss Web3 Foundation synergistic value proposition. Based on NFIDs FIDO2/WebAuthn innovations build on the Dfinity's enterprise-web speed public blockchain the Internet Computer. 

The Federal Department of Justice/Police (FDJP) and DigitalSwitzerland recommended ensuring an EU interoperable Swiss eID despite a real chance that stalled EU-Swiss treaty agreement negotiations could limit access to the EU's Horizon Europe Digital Identity funding programs. 

The Swiss presence in the Schengen free zone and the single market is advantageous for a Swiss NFID
