Positioning NFID as the Internet Computer "Gold-Standard" Key-Management plug-in across the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) / European Economic Area (EEA) in advance of the September 2022 eIDAS2 'toolbox' release is the primary focus of this updated Swiss Electronic Identification (eID) Use Case.

"With eIDAS 2, the E.U. Commission intends to make cross-border e-ID a reality. In a nutshell, by 2023, every E.U. member state must make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one." https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/eidas-regulations

The countdown for E.U. member state governments', private-sector SMEs, investors, developers, and entrepreneurs vying to update pre-notified/notified national eID schemes infrastructure under the prior eIDAS (electronic identification, strong authentication and trust services) has begun.

One of the key new elements of eIDAS2 is the introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets and the fact that these wallets can now also be provided by private service providers, which will allow for the creation of a new ecosystem for trust services. 

Comprehensive new 2022 European consumer protection regulations for eIDs unveil greenfield opportunities for complementary eID, strong-authentication and authorization solution workflows.

That enables citizens to keep access to Personal Identifiable Data (PID) biometrically protected on their personal devices (analogous to the ID in the wallet, verifiers and anyone else).

eIDAS 2.0 has evolved from eIDs to the European Commission's first update to its pan-EEA/EFTA Digital Identity framework. Introducing the European Digital Identity Wallet. (EUDIW)

eIDAS legal framework for electronic signatures was subsequently amended in the new eIDAS 2.0 Regulation with four additional services:

1.	electronic seals (electronic signatures for legal persons),
2.	website authentication, 
3.	timestamping and
4.	registered delivery services.

E.U. nations will be mandated to build an architecture to launch and support the new cross-border EDIW national eID schemes in 2023.

EIRA© (European Interoperability Reference Architecture), which defines the functionality of eIDAS 2.0, proposes to mandate for the EUDIW via autonomous and (re)usable EIRA© Solution Building Block (SBB) that map to Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) of EIRA©

Designing an NFID-Dfinity IC-based Swiss eID as a collaborative non-competitive component of EIRA© in support of:

 a.	the Q1 2022 Swisscom and Orell Füssli digital certificate partnership 
 b.	the Q1 2022 SwissSign SSI-joint State of Aargau and Adnovum project 
 c.	the State of Zug decentralised identity for eGov ti&m, HSLU, and 
 d.	uPort project could be a low-hanging fruit opportunity.

Considered the most advanced Swiss eID projects with considerable resources, they may find NFIDs build on the only entirely non-profit Swiss Web3 Foundation's synergistic value proposition. Based on NFIDs, FIDO2/WebAuthn innovations - are built on the Dfinity's enterprise-web speed public blockchain, the Internet Computer.

The Federal Department of Justice/Police (FDJP) and DigitalSwitzerland recommended ensuring an E.U. interoperable Swiss eID despite a real chance that stalled EU-Swiss treaty agreement negotiations could limit access to the E.U.'s Horizon Europe Digital Identity funding programs.

The development of a Dfinity-IC-based NFID-Suiss--an "anonymous by default strong-authentication process" accelerates NFID's mission to become the privacy-preserving identity layer of the Internet.

The Commission is investing heavily to provide a Self-Sovereign, Non-Fungible Identity Choice for the 508 million citizens of the Digital Single Market, one of the European Commission's ten political priorities close the digital gap between the U.S. and China. 

$20 trillion in GDP, Europe has the 2nd largest GDP globally, right behind China and ahead of the U.S. Brexit showcased despite the E.U. representing 15% of the world's economy, it is forcast to fall to about 12% by 2030.

The EUDIW is touted as the remedy to reverse the forecast; Blockchain Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is touted by only a few as key toCommission'sion's economic growth initiative.  

Although eliminating U.S. and China platform pan-EU lock-in mandatory for EUDIWs, there is no mandate from the E.U. that all member states use blockchain technology to implement the European digital identity framework.

NFID is well-positioned to offer

* data-subject controlled
* secure and frictionless
* privacy-preserving
* platform-agostic eIDs across the E.U.  

The proposed collobarative Use Case provides the SBB for low-cost, low-effort deployment of FIDO2 standard, consisting of the W3C WebAuthn standard and the FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) and deploy the pluggable web-browser interface from Crypto Valley as EIRA© SBB. 

Designed to be in compliance with not only the E.U. privacy laws consisting of the 

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 
the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) and 
the European Data Protection Board. (EDPB) 

The robust privacy invoked by E.U. data protection regulations is based on the constitutional privacy declarations in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights: Articles 7 and 8 mandate individual E.U. citizens the respect for private life and the protection of personal data.

They are forming the most enforceable transparent, accountable data protection regulatory compliance structure for controlling the processing and flow of Personal Identifiable Data (PID) on the European continent.  

By monetizing the wave of NexGen eTrust Regulation guidelines on enforcement in the E.U. and the privacy decision directives in the pipeline:

° the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)
° the Data Act (DA)
° the Data Governance Act (DGA)
° the European Digital Identity Framework (EDIF)
° the Digital Markets Act (DMA)
° the Digital Services Act (DSA)
° the European Health Data Space (EHDS)
° the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Identity Proofing Standard
° the Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2)
° the 5th Anti Money Laundering Directive (AML5)
° the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)
° the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)
° the Standard contractual Clauses (SCC)
° the new electronic IDentification, Authentic and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0)
° the Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) Toolkit

In convergence with the (fully-revised) 2022 Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) and the New Swiss DLT Act, they facilitate digital identity for all European citizens and a new universal standard for the world.

The 2021 DLT Law is one of the only blockchain legal frameworks that foster clear-line-of-liability for cross-border data-privacy-protected eService transactions.

NexGen enterprise ITC stacks, eliminating cloud storage vulnerabilities while ensuring citizens complete control of personal data and digital assets while drastically cutting costs.

"STOs are Security Token Offerings. In Switzerland, the law (OR) allows to mint shares on a blockchain as so-called ledger-based securities. This means that when you buy shares of companies listed on our website, you are buying a fully-fledged share of a Swiss company. No digital twin or the like - the token is the share! Security tokens are much easier to transfer than other forms of shares. Therefore, they allow a trading system that does not require any financial intermediaries at all. This makes trading more efficient, cheaper and also allows investments in private companies, which until now were almost exclusively accessible to very rich people and institutional investors.Thanks to security tokens and shareholders, private companies become accessible to everyone."
