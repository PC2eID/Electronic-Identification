l Positioning NFID as the Internet Computer "Gold-Standard" Key-Management plug-in across the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) / European Economic Area (EEA) in advance of the September 2022 eIDAS2 'toolbox' release is the primary focus of this updated Swiss Electronic Identification (eID) Use Case.

The countdown for EU member state governments', private-sector SMEs, investors, developers, and entrepreneurs vying to update pre-notified/notified national eID schemes infrastructure under the prior eIDAS (electronic identification, authentication and trust services)

eIDAS 2.0 has evolved from eIDs to the European Commission's first update to its pan-EEA/EFTA Digital Identity framework. Introducing the European Digital Identity Wallet. (EUDIW)

"With eIDAS 2, the EU Commission intends to make cross-border e-ID a reality. In a nutshell, by 2023, every EU member state must make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one." https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/eidas-regulations

EIRA© (European Interoperability Reference Architecture), which defines the functionality of eIDAS 2.0, proposes to mandate for the EUDIW via autonomous and (re)usable EIRA© Solution Building Block (SBB) that map to Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) of EIRA©

eIDAS legal framework for electronic signatures was subsequently amended in the eIDAS Regulation with four additional services:

1.	electronic seals (electronic signatures for legal persons),
2.	website authentication, 
3.	timestamping and
4.	registered delivery services.

EU nations will be mandated to build an architecture to launch and support the new cross-border EDIW national eID schemes in 2023.

Designing an NFID-Dfinity IC-based Swiss eID as a collaborative non-competitive component of EIRA© in support of:

a.	the Q1 2022 Swisscom and Orell Füssli digital certificate partnership 
b.	the Q1 2022 SwissSign SSI-joint State of Aargau and Adnovum project 
c.	the State of Zug decentralised identity for eGov ti&m, HSLU, and 
d.	uPort project could be a low hanging fruit opportunity.

Considered the most advanced Swiss eID projects with considerable resources, they may find NFIDs build on the only entirely non-profit Swiss Web3 Foundation's synergistic value proposition. Based on NFIDs, FIDO2/WebAuthn innovations - built on the Dfinity's enterprise-web speed public blockchain, the Internet Computer.

The Federal Department of Justice/Police (FDJP) and DigitalSwitzerland recommended ensuring an EU interoperable Swiss eID despite a real chance that stalled EU-Swiss treaty agreement negotiations could limit access to the EU's Horizon Europe Digital Identity funding programs.

„Without too much fanfare, the European Commission has recently put forward plans that might cause the largest leap forward in the European digital identity scene in the past twenty years.“ https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/european-digital-identity-framework/

One of the key new elements of eIDAS2 is the introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets and the fact that these wallets can now also be provided by private service providers, which will allow for the creation of a new ecosystem for trust services. 

The development of an Dfinity-IC-based NFID-Suiss--an "anonymous by default authentication process" accelerates NFID's mission to become the privacy-preserving identity layer of the Internet.

Offering a Self-Sovereign, Non-Fungible Identity Choice to the 500+ million citizens of the EU Digital Single Market:

* data-subject controlled
* secure and frictionless
* privacy-preserving
* platform-agostic eIDs.

Comprehensive new 2022 European consumer protection regulations for eIDs unveil greenfield opportunities for complementary eID identification, authentication and authrization SBBs. 

FIDO2 standard consisting of the W3C WebAthn standard and the FIDO Client to Autheticator Protocol (CTAP) deployed from Crypto Valley in compliance with the 

-European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Identity Proofing Standard
-Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2)

The Swiss presence in the Schengen free zone and the single market is advantageous for a Swiss NFID
